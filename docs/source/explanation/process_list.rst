What is a process list?
------------------------

A process list is a YAML file with instructions which is needed to execute processing of data in HTTomo. This process list file consists of methods exposed as YAML `templates <https://diamondlightsource.github.io/httomo/reference/templates.html>`_ stacked together 
to form a usually longer serially processed sequence.
