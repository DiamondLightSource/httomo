.. _backends_list:

Supported libraries
===================

HTTomo currently supports several software packages that are used as
`backends` to perform data processing and reconstruction. The list of
the external packages will be growing in future to meet users' needs.

If the package has a modular structure with an easy access to every
method, for example as in the `TomoPy <https://tomopy.readthedocs.io>`_
software or in the `scikit <https://scikit-image.org/>`_ library, then the
integration process is straightforward.

A YAML template can be generated by using `YAML generator <https://diamondlightsource.github.io/httomo-backends/utilities/yaml_generator.html>`_,
or manually. More complicated in structure packages would need an additional wrapping, see :ref:`info_wrappers`.

Please see the provided list of :ref:`reference_templates`.

TomoPy software (CPU)
---------------------
`TomoPy <https://tomopy.readthedocs.io>`_ is an open-source Python package for
tomographic data processing and image reconstruction developed at
`The Advanced Photon Source <https://www.aps.anl.gov/>`_ in Illinois, USA.
The project is active since 2013 and it gained a `large audience <https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy>`_
of users and contributors across tomographic imaging community.

* TomoPy is an open-source package in Python and C for data processing and reconstruction. TomoPy is mostly a CPU processing library and in HTTomo we expose the CPU modules only.
* It is a CPU-multithreaded package. HTTomo controls parallelisation through MPI on a higher level and also supports local CPU multithreading from TomoPy, for every MPI process.
* TomoPy is a library of stand-alone methods which can be easily integrated into HTTomo. Notably not all TomoPy methods are integrated in HTTomo because of the I/O nature of some modules. Please see the list of available TomoPy :ref:`reference_templates`.

HTTomolibgpu library (GPU)
--------------------------
`HTTomolibgpu <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/httomolibgpu>`_ library is developed at `Diamond Light source  <https://www.diamond.ac.uk/>`_
by Data Analysis Group to work together with the HTTomo software.

* HTTomolibgpu is a Python library of GPU accelerated methods written using `CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_ API and CUDA language.
* Most of the original methods have been taken from TomoPy or `Savu <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/Savu>`_ software and then re-optimised and GPU-accelerated.
* It is a fully modular library and methods can be used stand-alone, however the GPU memory distribution feature of HTTomo will not be available. This means that the methods can silently fail if the GPU memory is overflowed.

HTTomolib library (CPU)
--------------------------
`HTTomolib <https://github.com/DiamondLightSource/httomolib>`_ library is similar to HTTomolibgpu, but contains mostly CPU modules.
