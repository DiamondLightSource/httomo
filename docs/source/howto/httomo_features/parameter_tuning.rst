Parameter Tuning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is it?
===========

Parameter tuning (also called "parameter sweeping") refers to providing multiple
values for a specific parameter of a method, and then running that method on its
input data with the different values for that parameter.

How would this be useful when processing data?
==============================================

This feature is typically used when prototyping a process list and it is
difficult to guess a reasonable value of a method's parameter. There could be
many reasons for this situation, such as being unfamiliar with the method, or
working with unfamiliar data, etc.

.. warning::
    Because of the significant modifications in HTTomo ver.2.0, the parameters tuning feature is not
    currently supported. HTTomo developers recognise the importance of it for users and will be
    delivered as soon possible with the next release.
