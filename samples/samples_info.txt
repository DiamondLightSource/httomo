This needs to be converted to Documentation file where details for every sample are exposed:

pipeline_template_examples:
  - pipeline_cpu1.yaml: Basic TomoPy (CPU-only) reconstruction pipeline for the classical 180 degrees scan
  - pipeline_cpu2.yaml: More advanced TomoPy reconstruction pipeline for the classical 180 degrees scan. The result of the data is now saved as hdf5 file in the reconstruction module. 
  - pipeline_cpu3.yaml: TomoPy-CPU pipeline (180 scan) but using `calculate_stats` module to extract global statistics in order to be passed to `save_to_images` function which uses it for data normalisation when saving images.
  - pipeline_gpu1.yaml: Basic GPU-driven pipeline which uses function from the httomolibgpu library.

python_templates:
  - pipeline_cpu1.py (same pipeline as pipeline_cpu1.yaml)
  - pipeline_cpu2.py (same pipeline as pipeline_cpu1.yaml)
  - pipeline_cpu3.py (same pipeline as pipeline_cpu1.yaml)
  - pipeline_gpu1.py (same pipeline as pipeline_cpu1.yaml)
